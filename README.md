# Fake Reviews Detection

In this project, we are attempting the problem of Fake Review Detection on the Yelp restaurant review dataset. We explore rule-based, machine learning and aggregation based approaches. The rules were based on our data analysis. For machine learning we consider dealing with textual and non-textual features separately. To get the best of both rule-base and machine learning, we explore different combination/aggregation mechaniisms in our project implementation.
